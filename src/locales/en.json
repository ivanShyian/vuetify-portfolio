For a year I have been intensively studying front-end development. The entire learning process proceeded independently through reading the documentation, analyzing examples of experienced developers and, of course, with the help of courses. Most of my knowledge I received in courses that raised my knowledge to a new level. I also continue to develop and work on my skills and myself in particular!",
